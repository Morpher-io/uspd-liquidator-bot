# üöÄ USPD Liquidation Bot - Earn Rewards by Securing the Protocol

**Turn market volatility into profit opportunities!** The USPD Liquidation Bot automatically monitors and liquidates undercollateralized positions in the [USPD protocol](https://uspd.io), earning you liquidation bonuses while helping maintain the stability of the US Permissionless Dollar.

*The bot automatically discovers positions, calculates profitability, and executes liquidations with detailed logging*

## üí∞ Why Run a Liquidation Bot?

**Liquidation rewards are substantial and consistent:**
- **5-10% liquidation bonus** on every successful liquidation
- **Automatic profit calculation** ensures only profitable liquidations are executed
- **Real-time monitoring** catches opportunities as they emerge
- **Tiered liquidation thresholds** - earlier NFT holders get better liquidation opportunities
- **Market volatility = more opportunities** - ETH price drops create liquidation events

### Example Profit Scenario
- Position has $2,300 USPD debt
- ETH drops, position becomes undercollateralized
- You liquidate and earn 5% bonus = **$115 profit**
- Minus gas costs (~$45) = **~$70 net profit per liquidation**
- Multiple liquidations per day during volatile markets = **significant daily earnings**

## üèóÔ∏è How USPD Liquidations Work

The USPD protocol maintains its $1 peg through overcollateralized positions backed by stETH. When ETH prices fall, some positions become undercollateralized and eligible for liquidation. Learn more about the [USPD economics and liquidation mechanics](https://uspd.io/docs/economics).

**Key concepts:**
- **Stabilizer Positions**: Individual collateralized debt positions backed by stETH
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Typically 110-125% collateralization ratio
- **Liquidation Bonus**: 5-10% reward for liquidators
- **Position Escrows**: Smart contracts holding the actual collateral

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- An Ethereum wallet with some ETH for gas fees
- USPD tokens for liquidations (can be acquired via DEX or minting)
- Etherscan API key (free)
- RPC endpoint (Alchemy, Infura, etc.)

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd uspd-liquidation-bot
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# RPC Configuration - Get from Alchemy, Infura, etc.
RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key
WS_RPC_URL=wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key

# Your wallet private key (keep this secure!)
PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef...

# Network (1 = Mainnet, 11155111 = Sepolia testnet)
CHAIN_ID=1

# Get free API key from etherscan.io
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key

# Your Stabilizer NFT ID (0 for default, lower IDs get better thresholds)
LIQUIDATOR_NFT_ID=0

# Bot Configuration
MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.01          # Minimum profit in ETH
PRICE_UPDATE_INTERVAL=30000        # Price check interval (30 seconds)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=300000    # Position update interval (5 minutes)
```

### 3. Run the Bot
```bash
npm start
```

For verbose logging:
```bash
npm start -- --verbose
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guide

### Environment Variables Explained

#### **RPC Configuration**
- `RPC_URL`: HTTP RPC endpoint for blockchain interactions
- `WS_RPC_URL`: WebSocket RPC endpoint for real-time event monitoring
- **Recommended providers**: Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode

#### **Wallet Configuration**
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet's private key (must start with 0x)
- **Security**: Never commit this to version control, use a dedicated liquidation wallet

#### **Network Configuration**
- `CHAIN_ID`: 
  - `1` = Ethereum Mainnet
  - `11155111` = Sepolia Testnet (for testing)

#### **API Configuration**
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Free API key from etherscan.io for fetching contract ABIs
- **Rate limits**: Free tier allows 5 calls/second, 100,000 calls/day

#### **Liquidator Configuration**
- `LIQUIDATOR_NFT_ID`: Your Stabilizer NFT ID
  - `0` = Default (110% liquidation threshold)
  - Lower IDs get better thresholds (e.g., ID 1 = 124.5%, ID 10 = 120%)
  - **Advantage**: Earlier NFT holders can liquidate positions at higher ratios

#### **Bot Behavior**
- `MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD`: Minimum profit in ETH to execute liquidation
- `PRICE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to check ETH prices (milliseconds)
- `POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to refresh position data (milliseconds)
- `VERBOSE_LOGGING`: Set to `true` for detailed logging

### Advanced Configuration
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_LIQUIDATIONS=3`: Limit simultaneous liquidations
- `MAX_GAS_PRICE=50`: Maximum gas price in gwei
- `LIQUIDATION_BONUS_PERCENT=5`: Expected liquidation bonus percentage

## üîß How It Works

### 1. **Position Discovery**
The bot automatically discovers all Stabilizer NFT positions by:
- Querying the StabilizerNFT contract for total supply
- Fetching position escrow addresses for each NFT
- Loading position data (collateral, debt, owner)

### 2. **Health Monitoring**
For each position, the bot continuously:
- Fetches current ETH/USD price from USPD oracle
- Calculates collateralization ratio using position escrow contracts
- Converts cUSPD shares to actual USPD debt using yield factors
- Determines liquidation eligibility based on thresholds

### 3. **Profit Calculation**
Before liquidating, the bot calculates expected profit:
- **Liquidation bonus**: 5% of debt value
- **Gas costs**: Estimated transaction fees
- **Net profit**: Bonus minus costs
- **Threshold check**: Only proceeds if profit exceeds minimum

### 4. **Liquidation Execution**
When a profitable opportunity is found:
- Acquires necessary USPD tokens
- Calls `StabilizerNFT.liquidatePosition()`
- Receives stETH collateral plus bonus
- Logs transaction details and profit

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security
- **Use a dedicated wallet** for liquidation activities
- **Keep minimal ETH balance** for gas fees only
- **Never share your private key** or commit it to version control
- **Consider using a hardware wallet** for key management

### Operational Security
- **Monitor bot activity** regularly
- **Set reasonable profit thresholds** to avoid unprofitable liquidations
- **Keep USPD balance** for liquidation opportunities
- **Update dependencies** regularly for security patches

### Risk Management
- **Start with testnet** (Sepolia) to familiarize yourself
- **Begin with conservative settings** (higher profit thresholds)
- **Monitor gas prices** during high network congestion
- **Have emergency stop procedures** ready

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient USPD balance"**
- Acquire USPD tokens from a DEX (Uniswap, etc.)
- Or mint USPD through the protocol if you have stETH

**"Liquidation profit too low"**
- Lower your `MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD`
- Wait for more volatile market conditions
- Check if your `LIQUIDATOR_NFT_ID` gives you better thresholds

**"Failed to fetch deployments"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify RPC endpoints are working
- Ensure Etherscan API key is valid

**"Contract ABI not found"**
- Verify contract addresses are correct
- Check if contracts are verified on Etherscan
- Clear ABI cache: `rm -rf abi-cache/`

### Debug Mode
Run with additional logging:
```bash
DEBUG=* npm start
```
